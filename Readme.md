# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and projects covering Python programming from **basics** to **intermediate** and **advanced** topics. It’s designed to help learners progress step-by-step and build a strong foundation in Python.

## Contents

- **Basics/** — Python fundamentals, syntax, variables, data types, control flow, functions.
- **Intermediate/** — Modules, file handling, error handling, OOP concepts, decorators, generators.
- **Advanced/** — Concurrency (threads, async), metaprogramming, design patterns, performance optimization.

## Installation

No special installation required to explore the code. However, it’s recommended to use a virtual environment if you want to run scripts with dependencies.
