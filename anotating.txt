In programming, when you annotate a variable, you tell the computer what type of data it holds.
age: int = 25

Here, : int is the annotation — it tells us age is an integer.
It helps tools catch errors and makes your code easier to understand.

They don’t enforce types at runtime — Python won’t throw an error if the type is wrong 
unless you use tools like mypy.

Functions can be annotated too:
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello " + name
This says: name should be a string, and the function returns a string.

Annotations improve collaboration, especially in big projects, because everyone knows 
what type is expected.
