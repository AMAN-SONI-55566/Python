# Arithmetic operators
# Python can calculate numbers using 
# common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:  
# x + y      |     Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
# x - y      |     Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
# x * y      |     Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
# x / y      |     Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
# x**y       |     Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of y 
# x**2       |     Square expression returns x squared
# x**3       |     Cube expression returns x cubed
# x**(1/2)   |     Square root (Â½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
# x // y     |     Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
# x % y      |     Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

# The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order: 

# Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
# Exponents xy   (x**y)
# Multiplication * and Division /  
# Addition + and Subtraction -    
#  You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.
