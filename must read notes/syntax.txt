Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. 
Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark 
your code as incorrect. This reflects real-life coding errors in the sense that a single error in 
spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise 
syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using 
programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. 

Common syntax errors:

Misspellings
Incorrect indentations
Missing or incorrect key characters:
Parenthetical types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }
Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’
Block introduction characters, like colons - :
Data type mismatches
Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words.
Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language.
