Built-in functions
In the last video, we explored built-in functions in Python, including print(), type(), 
and str(). Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called 
directly. In this reading, you’ll explore these further and also learn about the sorted()
function and max()and min() function. In addition, you'll review how to pass the output 
of one function into another function.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
print() 
The print() function outputs a specified object to the screen. The print() function is one 
of the most commonly used functions in Python because it allows you to output any detail 
from your code.

To use the print() function, you pass the object you want to print as an argument to the 
function. The print() function takes in any number of arguments, separated by a comma, & 
prints all of them. For example, you can run the following code that prints a string, a 
variable, another string, and an integer together:

month = "September"
print("Investigate failed login attempts during", month, "if more than", 100)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type()   
The type() function returns the data type of its argument. The type() function helps you 
keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code. 

To use it, you pass the object as an argument, and it returns its data type. It only
accepts one argument. For example, you could specify type("security") or type(7).

Passing one function into another->
When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to 
output the data type to the screen. This is the case when using a function like type(). 
Consider the following code:

print(type("This is a string"))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

str()
The str() function can be used to convert any data type to a string. The str()function 
takes a single argument, which is the value that you want to convert to a string. The 
str() function will then return a string representation of the value.

number = 12
string_representation = str(number)
print(string_representation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


sorted()
The sorted() function sorts the components of a list. The sorted() function also works on 
any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts
them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from 
smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables 
that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that 
begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.

The sorted() function takes an iterable, like a list or a string, as an input. So, for 
example, you can use the following code to sort the list of login sessions from shortest 
to longest:

time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
print(sorted(time_list))


The sorted() function does not change the iterable that it sorts. The following code 
illustrates this:
time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
print(sorted(time_list))
print(time_list)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

max() and min() 
The max() function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The min() function 
returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.

The max() and min() functions accept arguments of either multiple numeric values or of an 
iterable like a list, and they return the largest or smallest value respectively.

For example, you could use these functions to identify the longest or shortest session 
that a user logged in for. If a specific user logged in seven times during a week, and 
you stored their access times in minutes in a list, you can use the max() and min() 
functions to find and print their longest and shortest sessions:

time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
print(min(time_list))
print(max(time_list))
