	m = km * 1000  # exactly 1000 meters in 1 kilometer
	return __


# Do not indent any of the following lines of code as they are
# meant to be located outside of the function above


    my_trip_kilometers = 55


# 2 Convert my_trip_kilometers to meters by calling the function above
    my_trip_meters =___(my_trip_kilometers)


# 3 Fill in the blank to print the result of converting my_trip_kilometers
print("The distance in meters is " + str(____))
